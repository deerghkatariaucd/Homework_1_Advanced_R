This project analyzes the relationship between **engine displacement** and **highway fuel efficiency** using the built-in `mtcars` dataset from the `ggplot2` package in R. The report includes:

- Summary statistics of fuel efficiency by vehicle class  
- An interactive boxplot comparing highway MPG across classes  
- Interpretation of trends based on engine size and vehicle type

The analysis is presented in a clean, interactive **Quarto HTML document** with visual enhancements for clarity and accessibility.
